1. Attached is a data file, data.csv, containing 5 year survival outcomes for 100,000 people. Each line of the file 
contains age at baseline, sex ("M" for male or "F" for female), a frailty index derived from a questionnaire given 
at baseline, and a "death" column indicating whether the person had died 5 years after baseline (1 means the person 
was dead 5 years later; 0 means the person was alive).

a. Use logistic regression to model 5 year mortality based on the provided variables.

b. Create an ROC plot to evaluate the performance of your model from step 1. Calculate the area under the curve (AUC).

c. Use bootstrapping to determine 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients of your logistic regression model 
from step 1.

2. Attached are three additional data files: claims.csv, policies.csv, and categories. The claims and policies files 
represent historical data for a set of 100 policy holders during the last 3 years or so. Each claim in the claims 
category has an associated code. Each code is present in the categories file and has an associated category. Please 
do the following:

a. For each member, determine age at policy start and age at policy end.

b. For each member, determine average claims per year in each of the categories in categories, as well as overall.

c. Write the results of a and b to a csv file.
